Prepared by: Linusha | Date: 08-06-2025

=======================================================================
1. Background of the Study:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction to the Data Set:
The dataset used is a simulated customer dataset from a SaaS company, containing customer-level information such as company size, industry, subscription type, feature usage, NPS rating, login frequency, support tickets, tenure, and churn status.

Problem Statement:
The company has observed a rise in customer churn. The objective is to identify behavioral and engagement patterns that contribute to churn and derive actionable insights.

Objective of the Study:
- Understand churn drivers using business metrics
- Visualize patterns and compare churned vs retained users
- Help stakeholders with data-driven churn-reduction decisions

=======================================================================
2. Literature Review:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview of the Dataset Used:
- Format: CSV file with 500 customer records
- Key fields: Customer_ID, Company_Size, Industry, Subscription_Type, Tenure, Login_Frequency, NPS_Rating, Feature_Usage_Score, Last_Interaction_Days, Churned

Explanation of the Dataset:
Each row represents a unique customer with demographic and usage behavior metrics. The 'Churned' column (0 or 1) indicates if the customer is still active.

Identification of Additional Resources:
- Power BI documentation for slicers and KPI visuals
- Articles on churn analytics in SaaS
- Support from Business Analytics learning materials

=======================================================================
3. Methodology:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Approach to Data Analysis:
- Load the CSV file into Power BI
- Categorize variables: Categorical (Company_Size, Industry, etc.) vs Numerical (Tenure, NPS, etc.)
- Aggregated comparisons using bar charts and slicers

Data Exploration:
- Examined average churn by segments
- Explored distributions for NPS, logins, and feature usage

Data Cleansing:
- Verified no nulls or missing values
- Filtered out cases with 0 login or low feature usage for targeted analysis

Visualization Techniques Employed:
- Clustered Column Charts to compare churned vs retained users
- Slicers for Industry, Company Size, and Subscription Type

Overview of the Dashboard and Its Components:
- 6 bar charts covering:
  - Churn by Subscription Type and Company Size
  - Average NPS Rating, Login Frequency, Feature Usage Score, and Last Interaction Days
- Filters (Slicers) for easy exploration by business segments

=======================================================================
4. Insights and Conclusions:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summarized Findings from the Dashboard:
1. Churned users have lower feature usage (0.44) vs retained (0.64)
2. NPS rating is significantly lower for churned users (4.06) than retained (5.45)
3. Retained users log in more frequently (7.53 vs 5.33)
4. Churned users have longer inactivity (38.36 days vs 26.66 days)
5. Minimal churn difference by Subscription Type and Company Size

Recommendations:
- Improve feature onboarding for new users
- Launch inactivity-based nudges for users >30 days inactive
- Monitor customers with NPS <5 for intervention
- Focus more on behavioral data over business segment
