# Customer Churn Analysis – SaaS Platform (Power BI Dashboard)

This project explores the behavioral and satisfaction-driven factors behind customer churn for a simulated SaaS business. Using **Power BI**, I’ve built a clear, interactive dashboard that enables teams to track churn indicators and take action.

---

## Objective

- Identify customer behaviors that lead to churn
- Use visual insights to support churn-reduction strategies
- Build an executive dashboard with slicers & clean layout

---

## Data Overview

- 500 customers from a SaaS dataset
- Key columns: `Subscription_Type`, `Company_Size`, `NPS_Rating`, `Login_Frequency`, `Feature_Usage_Score`, `Last_Interaction_Days`, `Churned`
- Format: CSV (cleaned and used in Power BI)

---

## Dashboard Highlights

- **Churn Rate by Subscription Type and Company Size**
- **Average NPS Rating**, **Login Frequency**, and **Feature Usage Score** for churned vs retained
- **Days Since Last Interaction** vs Churn
- **Slicers** for: Company Size, Subscription Type, Industry

---

## Key Insights

- Customers using fewer features (avg 0.44) are more likely to churn
- NPS rating of churned users is only 4.06 (vs 5.45 for retained)
- Inactive customers (>30 days) are high-risk
- Monthly vs Annual churn rate is similar (~25%)

---

## Recommendations

- Proactive nudges for users inactive >30 days
- Improve feature onboarding in the first 2 months
- Monitor users with NPS < 5 and login frequency < 6/week

---

## Tools Used

- Power BI (Data modeling + Visualization)
- Excel (Initial exploration)
- GitHub (Versioning + Portfolio sharing)

---

## Files Included

- `Dashboard.pbix` – Final Power BI dashboard
- `Customer_Churn_SaaS_RawNPS.csv` – Clean dataset
- `Customer_Churn_Project_Report.txt` – Full project documentation
